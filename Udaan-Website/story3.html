        <h1>Overcoming Behavioral Challenges</h1>
        <p><strong>Child:</strong> Sneha, 14 years old</p>
        <p><strong>Success Story</strong><br>
            Sneha, a 14-year-old girl, faced severe behavioral issues, including frequent emotional outbursts and difficulties managing anger. These challenges stemmed from past trauma, making it hard for Sneha to connect with peers and participate in school activities. She often felt isolated and struggled to cope with her emotions in a healthy way.
            <br>To help Sneha, Aarti, a trained mentor specializing in emotional support, was paired with her through Udaanâ€™s platform. Aarti worked with Sneha on a weekly basis, using innovative techniques like storytelling and role-playing to help her build emotional regulation skills.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Over time, Sneha learned to manage her emotions more effectively. Her outbursts became less frequent, and she gained the confidence to engage in group activities at school. As a result, Sneha earned recognition from her teachers and peers as a valuable team player. The mentoring process not only helped Sneha overcome her behavioral challenges but also empowered her to connect with others and thrive socially.
