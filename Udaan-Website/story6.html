        <p><strong>Child:</strong> Rohit, 18 years old</p>
        <p><strong>Success Story</strong><br>
            Rohit, an 18-year-old boy, dreamed of pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering but faced significant financial challenges. Despite his academic excellence and determination, the cost of tuition, study materials, and travel expenses made it nearly impossible for him to pursue his dream of higher education.
            <br>Udaan connected Rohit with a sponsor who was willing to cover his tuition fees. Additionally, the platform launched crowdfunding campaigns to help cover his study materials and travel expenses. The combined support from both the sponsor and generous donors ensured that Rohit could focus on his education without the constant worry of financial constraints.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Thanks to the support he received through Udaan’s platform, Rohit is now enrolled in his first year of mechanical engineering at a prestigious college. 
            <br>With the ongoing backing from Udaan’s community, Rohit is excelling in his studies and is determined to complete his degree and contribute to the engineering field. 
            <br>He is now one step closer to realizing his dreams, with a bright future ahead.
