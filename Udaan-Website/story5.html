        <h1>Vocational Training Support</h1>
        <p><strong>Child:</strong> Kavya, 16 years old</p>
        <p><strong>Success Story</strong><br>
            Kavya, a 16-year-old girl, had a strong passion for tailoring and dreamed of turning it into a sustainable career. However, she lacked the financial resources to enroll in a vocational training course or purchase the necessary sewing equipment to develop her skills. Despite her determination, Kavya’s financial situation made it difficult for her to access the training she needed.
            <br>Udaan’s platform recognized Kavya’s potential and showcased her story on the Sponsorship Portal. The platform shared Kavya’s passion for tailoring and her goal of becoming financially independent. As a result, several generous donors contributed to funding her vocational training and sewing equipment.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> With the help of the funds raised through Udaan’s platform, Kavya successfully completed her tailoring training and invested in the equipment required to start her own business. Today, Kavya runs a small tailoring business, providing for her family and saving for her future goals. She is not only building a stable career but also becoming an inspiration to others in her community who face similar financial challenges.
